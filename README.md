- **Visualization 2** reveals that 5 minutes is the most common checkout duration for males, while 6 minutes is the most common checkout duration for females. Therefore, Citibikes are often checked out for short distance trips to and from a specific location.

- **Visualization 3** shows that Thursday at 6 pm is the peak time for bike checkout. This may coincide with users renting a Citibike to travel home at the end of a work day.

- **Visualization 6** illustrates the gender breakdown of Citibike users. 1,530,272 of all users are male, accounting for approximately 65% of all users. 588,431 of all users are female, accounting for approximately 25% of all users. 225,521 users are categorized as "Unknown" gender, accounting for approximately 10% of all users. This indicates that providing gender within the Citibike app is most likely not required for bike checkout to accommmodate for those who prefer not to share this information.

- **Two Additional Visualizations for Further Analysis:**

- One additional visualization that may provide helpful information would be a line graph illustrating the number of trips that can be filtered by user type, gender, and age. We've done a full analysis of usage by gender, but not as much by age. It would be helpful for stakeholders to gain a better understanding of the both the ages and genders of subscribers versus non-subscribers. This visualization has been provided below and indicates that subscribers are responsible for more trips, which is to be expected.  

**Number of Trips by User Type, Gender & Age**

![8_UserType_Gender_Age.png](Images/8_UserType_Gender_Age.png)

- An additional visualization that would be useful would be a line graph of birth date and user type to help gain an understanding the age distribution of subscribers so future marketing efforts could target these age groups as well as identify other age groups to target.
